# 90DaysOfDevOps-a-developers-take
 
I'm a software developer and I'm using this repository to document my journey towards a deeper knowledge of DevOps. This is inspired by Michael Cades' [#90DaysOfDevOps](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps) but builds onto my experience as a software developer. So no deep diving into Git basics, no chapter on a programming language. I will use the freed time to dive deeper into topics that are of special interest to software developers, like Kubernetes.
