# 90DaysOfDevOps-Challenge
 
I'm a software developer and I'm using this repository to document my journey towards a deeper knowledge of DevOps. This is inspired by Michael Cades' [#90DaysOfDevOps](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps) and I will also be dedicating one hour a day, 5 days a week for 90 days.
