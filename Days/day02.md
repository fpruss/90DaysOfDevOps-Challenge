## Michael's 2nd Day

On the second day, Michael provides a [high level overview](https://www.90daysofdevops.com/2022/day02/) of what DevOps is in his eyes.

If I understood correctly, Michael describes the responsibilities of DevOps roughly like:

1. Setting up CI/CD pipelines to automate build, test and deployment
2. Providing infrastructure (configuration and management)
3. Maintenance and scaling of infrastructure
4. Automation of tasks from deployment to testing
5. Ensure comprehensive testing before deployment
6. Maybe handle networking aspects

## The Resources Michael provided and my comments

Here DevOps is described as the intersection of development and operations and also as a process that aims to improve the speed and quality of code releases by minimizing the number of errors, bugs and roadblocks.
It was invented because traditionally teams where facing bureaucratic and slow release processes, miscommunications and lack of collaboration between developers and operations. 
DevOps is a process and role that evolved from more general concepts such as code management and infrastructure automation.
It is important to understand the basics of Linux, networking, monitoring and security in order to be a successful devops engineer.

## Other Resources

There is a nice [article](https://www.innoq.com/en/articles/2023/08/is-platform-engineering-the-new-devops/) by Sascha Selzer of Innoq that discusses the challenges 
of adopting DevOps practices and introduces the role of Platform Engineering as an alternative that tries to make the migration to self-sufficient teams easier.
