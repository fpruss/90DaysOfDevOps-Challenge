Went through the first resources below, which gives a good overview about Go's
language features. Also looked more into some of the syntax basics and Go's pointers.
To me Go's pointers seem to work exactly like in C (learned some C in my universisy
studies) but the second resource below discusses the differences. You can't increment
a pointer and alter the memory address for example in Go, which is a good thing.
