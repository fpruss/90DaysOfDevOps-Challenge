## My notes on Michael's [day04](https://www.90daysofdevops.com/2022/day04/) 

Agile focuses on optimizing communication between users and developers while DevOps is a set of internal practices.
There is no DevOps framework like there are Agile frameworks like Scrum. DevOps promotes practices like IaC, Monitorin, Self Healing, E2E test automation, ...
In agile the main source of feedback is the user, in DevOps the feedback from stakeholders and the team is prioritized higher.
Agile focusses more on software development, DevOps also focuses on deployment and post-release stages.
DevOps regards project documentation as essential whereas agile values working software over extensive documentation.
Of course both approaches can be combined.
