First I installed Go on my Ubuntu machine, following the resource below. Luckily
the package is available in the Ubuntu repositories. Then I followed the simple
hello world example in this resource. I'm using vim for this simple example, but
will download Goland.
I also followed the rest of the simple tutorial that can be found in the first resource below,
and also the tutorial found in the second resource.
