## My notes on Michael's [corresponding day](https://www.90daysofdevops.com/2022/day15/)
Michael explains a lot of basic commands on that day. But I have to confess I 
didn't know the "locate" command. Had to install it first, but nice command,
because the the syntax is easier than "find" and it's also faster, because it
just scans a prebuilt Linux database instead of the whole filesystem. Than of
course one must be aware of updating the DB manually if files are not found.

I have to say, that I don't like Michael's writing much, it's kind of sloppy
and hard to follow. I know, my writing isn't much better, but I hope Michael's
'blog' gets better, otherwise I might change to another resource for learning.
To be fair, it started as his own learning path, but now it's promoted as a
learning resource for everybody.

Other command's I didn't know are 'awk', which seems to be a complex beast and
'cut', which seems to be very useful. I'll add a good blog I found on 'cut'
under 'Resources'.
And what I really like is 'getent', I'll add a link to a blog, that explains
this very well (sorry it's in german, for anybody that ever actually follows
this :wink:)
