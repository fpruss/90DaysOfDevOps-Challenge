From day 7 to day 12, Michael does some [Go learning](https://www.90daysofdevops.com/2022/day07/) which I will skip here.
I also want to learn Go, but I want to seperate this from my DevOps learning path
and do it properly at a different time. So my day 7 corresponds to Michael's day
14 and from now on my day numbers won't match Michael's. I will use the 7 days I
have won to dive deeper into DevOps tooling.

## My notes on Michael's [corresponding day](https://www.90daysofdevops.com/2022/day14/)
Michael's upcoming 7 days, starting with this one are on Linux. I'm already a
Linux user for some years, but of course there is still a lot to learn. Anyway,
not much more than setting up ubuntu in a VM happened on Michael's day.
I was using Manjaro for quiet a while, which I like a lot, especially in combination
with leftwm tiling window manager. But now I'm on ubuntu (with leftwm), which I don't
like too much, but it was easier to setup dual boot on my Lenove with TPM with ubuntu.
Need Windows for music production software (need to get a Mac someday again).

## Resources
Those just show the very basic CLI commands, skimmed through them very quickly, but
is a bit of a waste of time if you already know the basics. I hope Michael's learning
path gets more detailed and interesting, otherwise I consider doing a more in depth
linux course on the side.
