## My notes on Michael's [corresponding day](https://www.90daysofdevops.com/2022/day18/)
This day is about SSH, but because my IT Security (or Cybersecurity) studies
are still very fresh, I go over Michael's notes quickly, to see if there is something
I don't know yet. If he's not going into port-forwarding, I will check this again
later. That's one thing I forgot the details about.
