## What is DevOps?

I found the following videos helpful to get a rough understanding, but of course there are ton more videos on YT:
- [DevOps in 5 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrgk023l4lI)
- [What is DevOps? Easy Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gpe1Zn-1fE&t=43s)

Also I liked Michael Cade's explanation from his repo:  
  
<em>
"DevOps is a set of practices that help to reach the goal of this movement: reducing the time between the ideation phase of a product and its release in production to the end-user or whomever it could be an internal team or customer.

[...]  
The high-level takeaway is that a DevOps mindset or culture is about shrinking the long, drawn out software release process from potentially years to being able to drop smaller releases more frequently. The other key fundamental point to understand here is the responsibility of a DevOps engineer to break down silos between the teams I previously mentioned: Developers, Operations and QA.

From a DevOps perspective, Development, Testing and Deployment all land with the DevOps team.

The final point I will make is to make this as effective and efficient as possible we must leverage Automation."</em>

## DevOps Tooling Overview

On this first day, I started with going through all of Michaels recommended resources.
This one was useful to get a good overview what to learn to become a DevOps: [So you want to learn DevOps?](https://blog.kasten.io/devops-learning-curve)

There are some resources that help to get an overview over the DevOps tooling/Tech Stack: 
- [So you want to learn DevOps?](https://blog.kasten.io/devops-learning-curve)
- [DevOps roadmap 2022 | Success Roadmap 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l_n97Mt0ko)
- [From Zero to DevOps Engineer - DevOps Roadmap for YOUR specific background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nVMUtaqCk)

I think those are a nice starting point to plan out a learning journey, but those resources also might overwhelm and scare away people.
In my experience its always better to start with one little thing and iterate towards a bigger picture. The first chart could help to keep track of the process, but the roadmap videos might be not so useful for everybody.

I can't wait to get on with day 2, and I'm definitely looking forward to doing some hands on!
